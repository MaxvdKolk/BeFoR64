+ BeFoR64 is a pure Fortran (KISS) library for base64 encoding/decoding for modern (2003+) Fortran projects;
+ BeFoR64 is Fortran 2003+ standard compliant;
+ BeFoR64 is a Free, Open Source Project.

## What is BeFoR64?

Modern Fortran standards (2003+) have introduced better support for strings manipulations. Exploiting such new Fortran capabilities, BeFoR64 provides an easy to use module library for encoding and decoding Fortran types (binary internal representation) in ascii-[base64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64)-encoded string.

## Documentation

Besides this README file the BeFoR64 documentation is contained into its own [wiki](https://github.com/szaghi/BeFoR64/wiki). Detailed documentation of the API is contained into the [GitHub Pages](http://szaghi.github.io/BeFoR64/index.html) that can also be created locally by means of [ford tool](https://github.com/cmacmackin/ford).

### A Taste of BeFoR64
Let us assume our goal is encoding a binary integer. It is as simple as
```fortran
USE Lib_Base64
â€¦
character(len=:), allocatable:: code64 ! base64 encoded string
...
call b64_encode(n=12._R8P,code=code64)
print "(A)", code64
```

But you are not limited to a simple integer scalar, you can encode real, integer, characters scalar or arrays, and by means of the auxiliary `Lib_Pack` library also mixed types. See the [wiki](https://github.com/szaghi/BeFoR64/wiki).
